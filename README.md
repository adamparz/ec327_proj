Our project is a single player, top down, RPG game. The game works by having a player that moves through the map that is two floors with each floor and each floor has multiple rooms. To play the game, you use the "A", "W", "S", and "D" keys to move through the map. When you enter a room, you point your mouse cursor to where you want to launch the projectiles at the enemies. To launch, press the space key. Once the enemy has been defeated, it will disappear. Once you move through each room, a key will appear, and you will use that key to unlock the boss room to fight the boss. The game is over either in a win when you defeat the boss, or a loss when you lose all of your health before defeating the boss.

To build the project you enter GameMaker, you press the play button circled in red in the picture below. This will build the game and output it in a separate window that will allow you to play the game.
